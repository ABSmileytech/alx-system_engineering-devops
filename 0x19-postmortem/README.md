**Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Outage**

---

### **Issue Summary**

**Duration:** February 15, 2025, 10:30 AM - 12:45 PM UTC

**Impact:**
- 70% of users experienced slow load times or inability to access the web application.
- API requests were failing intermittently, causing issues with image uploads and compression processing.
- Admin dashboard was inaccessible due to backend timeouts.

**Root Cause:**
A database connection pool exhaustion caused by an unoptimized query, leading to cascading failures in the API services.

---

### **Timeline**

- **10:30 AM** - Monitoring alerts detected increased API response times.
- **10:35 AM** - Engineers began investigating, assuming it was a temporary traffic spike.
- **10:45 AM** - Users started reporting slow performance and upload failures.
- **11:00 AM** - Database logs revealed a high number of unclosed connections.
- **11:15 AM** - Misleading assumption: Increased server memory usage was causing the slowdown; restarted application servers.
- **11:30 AM** - Issue persisted, escalated to the database team.
- **11:45 AM** - Root cause identified: a long-running query causing connections to remain open.
- **12:00 PM** - Query optimization and connection pool adjustments implemented.
- **12:30 PM** - Services gradually recovered; continued monitoring.
- **12:45 PM** - Full resolution confirmed, postmortem initiated.

### **Root Cause and Resolution**

**Root Cause:**
- A newly deployed feature introduced an inefficient database query.
- The query did not properly utilize indexing, causing full table scans.
- Open connections were not being properly closed, leading to connection pool exhaustion.

**Resolution:**
- Optimized the problematic query to leverage indexing and reduce execution time.
- Increased the connection pool size to handle sudden spikes more effectively.
- Implemented a timeout mechanism for long-running queries.
- Deployed a hotfix and monitored system stability.

### **Corrective and Preventative Measures**

**Improvements:**
- Improve database query performance testing before deployment.
- Enhance connection pool monitoring and alerting mechanisms.
- Conduct regular audits on database indexing and query efficiency.

**Action Items:**
1. **Patch database queries** to avoid full table scans and improve indexing.
2. **Implement automated query profiling** to catch inefficient queries before deployment.
3. **Improve alerting mechanisms** to detect connection pool exhaustion earlier.
4. **Run load tests** before deploying database-intensive features.
5. **Add database connection auto-recovery mechanisms** to prevent future outages.

This postmortem outlines the critical events, the root cause, and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the outage, ensuring better system resilience in the future.
